        Casablanca, also known in Arabic as Dar al-Bayda"White House", Berber
        languages: ⵜⴰⴷⴷⴰⵔⵜ ⵜⵓⵎⵍⵉⵍⵜ is the largest city in Morocco and the
        country's economic and business center. Located on the Atlantic coast of
        the Chaouia plain in the central-western part of Morocco, the city has a
        population of about 3.71 million in the urban area, and over 4.27
        million in the Greater Casablanca, making it the most populous city in
        the Maghreb region, and the eighth-largest in the Arab world.

          Casablanca was developed on the site of an ancient city named<a

            target="_blank;"
            >Anfa</a
          >. It played an important role in Moroccan history at the end of the
          7th century and in the early 8th century. A prosperous city thanks to
          its agricultural hinterland, Anfa was also formerly a fishing port.

          Destroyed by the Portuguese attacks in the 15th and early 16th
          century,and the earthquake of 1755 the city had to wait until the 18th
          century to be rebuilt by the<a

            Sultan Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah</a
          >(1757-1790), who gave it the name of Dar al Beida. In the middle of
          the 19th century, the white city counted only a thousand inhabitants.
          Gradually, the city became more connected to the world through its
          port. It first sparked the interest of Europeans, who were motivated
          by trade. It hence asserted itself as the European counter for North
          Africa and became the leading export port in Morocco. The progress of
          steam navigation and the development of the textile industry drove the
          port's traffic, making the

          one of the leading wool providers in the Mediterranean basin. In 1862,
          a regular maritime connection was established between Marseille and
          Casablanca. Built in 1912, the port of Casablanca, the Kingdom's first
          major modern port, led to greater economic activity in the city and
          the region, and attracted many investors and workers. It hence shaped
          the destiny of the small city of Dar al Baida, making it the Kingdom's
          largest economic center, city and financial capital.
        
        <br>
          1910 through 1950 was a prosperous time for the city; major projects
          were implemented, namely the development of large avenues, the
          construction of big buildings, the establishment of regular maritime
          lines... this was also the time of the beginning of the automobile,
          with the Casablanca Euro-automobile Rally in 1920. The Allied invasion
          of North Africa in November 1942, namely that of the Americans in
          Casablanca called

          Casablanca is a city of resistance. Resistance to the French
          Protectorate was born in Casablanca. This was the work of the people
          of Casablanca. Great resistance fighters sacrificed their lives for
          the cause. During the deportation (1953-1955) of
          <a

          >by the French authorities, Casablanca the Resistant was inflamed.
          Upon the return of the Sultan, the women left their cloister to hail
          their ruler. A strong patriotism, ignited during the

          to free the Sahara from Spanish dominance. The delegation from
          Casablanca was the greatest, with a total of 35,000 volunteers. The
          people of Casablanca suffered from the Protectorate, Operation Torch,
          and the German response that ensued, as it made them flee to the
          hinterland. A strong patriotism, ignited during the Green March
          (1975), a peaceful march, an epic from the appeal of King Hassan II to
          free the Sahara from Spanish dominance. The delegation from Casablanca
          was the greatest, with a total of 35,000 volunteers. The people of
          Casablanca suffered from the Protectorate, Operation Torch, and the
          German response that ensued, as it made them flee to the hinterland.
          The resistance, the uprising of the people of Casablanca against the
          deportation of Sultan Mohamed V, the riots and protests of 1965 and
          1981 consolidated the solidarity of this population, creating a strong
          attachment to the monarchy, the nation and the city. Casablanca was
          the cradle of resistance to the protectorate. The old medina, the
          Habous, Derb Sultan, Derb Al Kabir… were the neighborhoods of armed
          resistance fighters. The "fidaiyine", as they were called, worked to
          buy back the country's political independence. "Al fidaa", literally,
          the "buyback". Large avenues in the city recall this nationalist
          upsurge and honor it with their names. Bd Al Fida intersects the
          neighborhoods of the resistance fighters. Bd de la Résistance which
          extends to Bd Zerktouni (leader of the resistance) surrounds the
          entire city.
